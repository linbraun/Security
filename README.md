This level prototype serves as a playground for learning and exploring various C++ features in game development. It showcases camera toggling, interactive objects, destructible environments, ray tracing displays, proximity lights, AI enemy behavior, and a health system. Additionally, the level prototype introduces an innovative object highlighting system, which identifies interactable objects upon intersecting with the player's cursor, providing a visual cue and allowing the player to interact directly with the object.
